## Problem Statement

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## Jupyter Notebooks  ![jupyter_logo](/images/illustrations/jupyter_logo_mod_sh.png)

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive way to explain code, visualize data and share your ideas with others. Further information on Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html).

The submitted Jupyter Notebook is accessed [here, **submission_notebook.ipynb**](submission_notebook.ipynb).
