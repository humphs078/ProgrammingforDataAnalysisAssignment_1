## Problem Statement

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

## Jupyter Notebooks  ![jupyter_logo](/images/illustrations/jupyter_logo_mod_sh.png)

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive way to explain code, visualize data and share your ideas with others. Further information on Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html).

The submitted Jupyter Notebook is accessed here - [submission_notebook.ipynb](submission_notebook.ipynb).

To run this file in a fully interactive way the Jupyter Notebooks server must be installed on the local machine. Instructions on how to install Jupyter Notebooks server can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Python Requirements ![python_logo](/images/illustrations/python_logo_mod_sh_title.png)

The following software libraries must be installed on the local machine to properly run the jupyter notebook:

- Matplotlib - `pip install matplotlib`
- Numpy -  `pip install numpy`
- Pandas - `pip install pandas`
- SciPy - python -m pip install scipy


To install using pip:

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

`pip install scipy`

To install using conda:

`conda install matplotlib`

`conda install numpy`

`conda install pandas`

`conda install scipy`
